## 🔎 What Is pact?

In everyday life, we make agreements—like "I will pay you after you deliver the goods." **pact** turns those agreements into clear, simple rules everyone can trust. It checks that no one breaks a deal. You don’t need technical skills to use it.

Using **pact** gives you:

- Clear, written contracts that are easy to follow.
- Tests that act as laws, ensuring all parts stick to the promises.
- Agents (computer helpers) that enforce rules and do not cheat.

Even if you never coded before, pact handles the hard part of making sure deals work right.

## ⚙️ How pact Works

pact focuses on contracts that happen before writing any actual code or programs. These contracts act like firm rules, guaranteeing both sides act honestly.

1. **Write the Contract:** You begin by defining what you expect. For example, "The seller must provide the product by Thursday."
2. **Test the Contract:** pact runs checks to ensure the contract works and no parts can cheat.
3. **Use Agents:** Automated helpers watch over deals and prevent cheating by ensuring both sides follow the contract strictly.

This way, you can trust the process without needing to watch it all the time.
